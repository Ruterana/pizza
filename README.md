This is pizza madness designed for helping people to order application where the customers order different sizes of pizzas with crust and toppings.  
and also we make delivery for them if they want for the affordable price.

### BDD
* Choose the size of pizza you want e.g Small, Medium, Large
* Choose what kind of crust you would like the pizza to have .
* send order for Pizza and see the total charge for it.
* Have an option to have the pizza delivered or not.  If delivered I want to be alerted how much the delivery charge will be.
* If I want my pizza to be delivered, I want to be prompted to enter where the delivery should be made and an alert saying '' your order will be delivered to your location"
* See a checkout button that when clicked shows the total amount charged for the orders.
